      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: October 15, 2024</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service.</p>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>We do not collect, store, use, or retain any personal data or information from users. Our service simply offers a way for users to export AI-generated content to their personal Notion workspace. This is done through the Notion OAuth authentication process, which allows users to authorize the connection between their workspace and our service. We do not process, store, or access any data within their Notion workspace.</p>

      <h2>Cloudflare Browser Insights and Traffic Tracking</h2>
      <p>We use <strong>Cloudflare Browser Insights</strong> to track and monitor website traffic and performance. This helps us analyze how the website is being used to improve user experience. However, no personal data is collected or stored as part of this tracking. The insights are aggregated and anonymized, focusing solely on website performance and interaction metrics.</p>

      <h2>How We Use LocalStorage</h2>
      <p>We use <strong>localStorage</strong> on your browser solely for the purpose of temporarily storing the AI-generated content. This ensures that the content remains available even after you are redirected back from Notion&apos;s authentication page, allowing you to export it to your workspace.</p>

      <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>Aside from Cloudflare Browser Insights, we do not use any cookies or other tracking technologies that collect personal data.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The only third-party service involved is <strong>Notion</strong>, which is used to authenticate your connection to your Notion workspace. Notion&apos;s Privacy Policy governs how they handle any personal data during this process. You can read their privacy policy <a href="https://www.notion.so/Privacy-Policy-346d1a91cb384be5b2f525dc0e0293d8">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top.</p>
